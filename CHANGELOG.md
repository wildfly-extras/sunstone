## 0.9.0 (2016-09-06)

- added new properties shared across cloud providers; These properties can be overriden
  by provider specific variants prefixed with `[providerType].` (e.g. `docker.bootScript`):
  - `bootScript` and `bootScript.file`
  - `stop.timeoutSec` and `start.timeoutSec`
- added support for Docker volume bindings; It's configured through a new `DockerNode`
  property `docker.volumeBindings` which accepts comma separated list of bindings

- added more restrictive permissions to the temporary files created for path resources 
  with `classpath:` prefix (if the underlying OS supports configuring the permissions)

  to join a single common virtual network

  the `Node.getProperty()` and `CloudProvider.getProperty()` methods are now
  deprecated and scheduled for removal
- added Azure ARM cloud provider, as a technical preview
- fixed closing nodes created by Arquillian extension when `@WithWildFlyContainer` is used
- use JClouds internal fork `2.0.0-eapqe.10` - with snakeyaml version update

- _Clouds_ renamed to **Sunstone**: Maven `groupId` is now
  `org.wildfly.extras.sunstone`, Maven `artifactId`s are now
  `sunstone-*`, package names are now `org.wildfly.extras.sunstone.*`,
  logger names are now `sunstone.*` (these changes are breaking),
  default configuration file is now `/sunstone.properties`
  (the older `/clouds.properties` and `/org/wildfly/extras/clouds/default.properties`
  are still recognized, but their support is deprecated and scheduled for removal)
- improved **performance of the Azure** cloud provider
- fixed resource leak in `SshClient`
- added option `leaveNodesRunning` to all cloud providers
  except of bare metal (where it doesn't make sense)
- added support for "user-data" to Azure cloud provider, mimics EC2 user-data
  functionality
- added configurable timeouts for management interface in `WildFlyNode`
  (properties `wildfly.management.connectionTimeoutInSec`,
  `wildfly.management.portOpeningTimeoutInSec`)
- added optional Azure node configuration which allows to set VM Agent provisioning
  (property `azure.provisionGuestAgent`)
- removed project dependency on `jclouds-log4j`

## 0.6.0 (2016-07-01)

  classpath resource, `/clouds.properties` is expected now
  (the old path still works, but is deprecated and scheduled for removal)
- all file-related properties now accept the `classpath:` prefix
- added `RedirectMode` support to `ExecBuilder.redirect*` methods,
  it newly allows to append output to existing file
- value delimiter in cloud properties system property value expressions
  changed from ":-" to ":"; It can be newly configured by setting 
  `clouds.sysprop.value.delimiter` system property
- added `CloudProvider.getProperty`, similarly to `Node.getProperty`
- added `ExecResult.assert*` assertion methods
- Azure now accepts properties `azure.ssh.user` and `azure.ssh.password`
  (the old `azure.login.name` and `azure.login.password` are still recognized,
  but deprecated and scheduled for removal)
- fixed an issue where too long computer name was generated on Azure
- Azure no longer adds `22` to the list of inbound ports if it's missing
- fixed node name creation for Docker
- use JClouds internal fork `2.0.0-eapqe.7` - handles EC2 VPC issues

## 0.5.1 (2016-06-01)

  to set username/password for Windows VM

## 0.5.0 (2016-06-01)

- added a Bare Metal cloud provider (not really cloud...)
- added `Node.ssh` for advanced usecases - it returns SSH client for the Node
- reworked Arquillian extension
  - added declarative way to specify suite-level Nodes
  - introduced object type `arquillian.suite`, it allows to define Nodes to be
    started for the suite and providers to be destroyed when the suite finishes

    `@WithWildFlyContainer` were added. The new annotations are designed only
    for controlling of class level nodes and containers.
  - the injection of `Node` or `CloudProvider` by using `@ArquillianResource`
    annotation doesn't create the instance if it doesn't exist already
- improved Docker provider
  - added `docker.tls.*` configuration options to `DockerCloudProvider`,
    they allow to configure access to TLS protected Docker endpoints
  - added `docker.privileged` and `docker.capAdd` configuration into
    `DockerNode`, it allows for instance to use `iptables` in containers
  - added `docker.apiVersion` to `DockerCloudProvider` configuration,
    it allows to control version in REST calls URL
- added `NodeWrapper` class into the `core` module, the `WildFlyNode` newly
  inherits from the `NodeWrapper`
- improved logging; all loggers now begin with `clouds.`
- `Node.exec`, `Node.copyFileFromNode`, `Node.copyFileToNode`
  and `ExecBuilder.exec` now throw more checked exceptions
- fixed copying files on Azure
- info about the Arquillian extension moved to `arquillian-README.md`
- info about `WildFlyNode` moved to `wildfly-README.md`

## 0.4.0 (2016-04-29)

- split project into 3 Maven modules `core`, `wildfly` and `arquillian`;
  you have to replace the dependency on `org.wildfly.extras.clouds:clouds`
  by dependencies on `clouds-core`, `clouds-wildfly` and `clouds-arquillian`
- added properties for configuring server operating mode for `WildFlyNode`
  (`standalone` or `domain`)
- added advanced support for command execution on `Node`s:
  `ExecBuilder` class allows to configure the commands to run
  on background (`nohup`) and/or with root privileges (`sudo`)
- `CloudProvider.Factory.createCloudProvider` methods are now deprecated,
   suggested replacement being `CloudProvider.create`
- image lookup for EC2 changed: `ec2.image` containing a readable
  name should be preferred to `ec2.image.id`, but `ec2.image.id`
  must still be used when `ec2.image` is ambiguous (or missing)
- image lookup for OpenStack changed: `openstack.image` containing a readable
  name should be preferred to `openstack.image.id`, but `openstack.image.id`
  must still be used when `openstack.image` is ambiguous (or missing)
- improved the default JClouds node group and made it configurable
  on a per-cloud-provider basis (`cloud.provider.xxx.nodegroup`)
  and per-node basis (`node.xxx.nodegroup`)
- improved selection of default floating IP pools in the OpenStack provider
  and made it configurable for each node (`openstack.floatingIpPools`)
